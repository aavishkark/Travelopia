# AboutTask

 1. Header Component:
-Developed a reusable Header component to enhance code modularity.
-Implemented dummy links using buttons to adhere to best practices when no actual link URLs are provided.
-Utilized CSS properties (display: flex and justify-content: space-around) to create a visually appealing header layout with equal spacing between buttons.
-Incorporated media queries for responsiveness, ensuring a seamless transition to a hamburger icon on screens with a width less than or equal to 400px.
-Added a subtle transition effect on page load, causing links to gracefully float from top to bottom before settling in the middle of the header.
-Integrated Chakra UI icons for the hamburger icon, enhancing visual appeal.
2. Middle Section:
-Created a container with overflow: hidden to maintain background image display consistency during dimension changes.
-Employed the position: absolute property for the background image, ensuring it covers the entire container.
-Implemented an overlay with background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45) and adjusted z-index values to cover the image seamlessly.
-Utilized a div with the .title class to display the title and a "Click Here" button with a higher z-index than the overlay.
-Implemented a flag boolean variable for dynamic control of the display properties of the alert and title components.
-Incorporated transition effects on the "Click Here" button and the "Ok" button, providing a responsive feel to user interactions.
3. Footer Component:
-Maintained consistency with the header by using the same background color and height.
-Incorporated a filler text, "Copyright Â© 2024 Travelopia. All rights reserved."
